        <p>
            <span class="highlight">What is Citizenship?</span><br>
            Being a citizen means that you belong to a country. Citizens have rights, like the right to vote, and responsibilities, like following the country's laws. In India, <strong>Part II of the Constitution</strong> explains who is an Indian citizen.
          </p>
          
          <h3>üìù Detailed Breakdown of Articles:</h3>
          
          <div class="article">
            <h4>Article 5</h4>
            <p>At the time India became a republic (January 26, 1950), anyone who lived in India, was born in India, or whose parents were born in India would be an Indian citizen.</p>
          </div>
        
          <div class="article">
            <h4>Article 6</h4>
            <p>After independence, some people moved from Pakistan to India. If they moved before July 19, 1948, they automatically became citizens. After that, they needed government permission.</p>
          </div>
        
          <div class="article">
            <h4>Article 7</h4>
            <p>This article explains that people who moved to Pakistan but returned to India could still be citizens if the government allowed it.</p>
          </div>
        
          <div class="article">
            <h4>Article 8</h4>
            <p>People of Indian origin living outside India, whose parents or grandparents were born in India, could apply to be citizens.</p>
          </div>
        
          <div class="article">
            <h4>Article 9</h4>
            <p>India does not allow dual citizenship. If you become a citizen of another country, you lose Indian citizenship.</p>
          </div>
        
          <div class="article">
            <h4>Article 10</h4>
            <p>Once you‚Äôre an Indian citizen, you stay a citizen unless the law says otherwise.</p>
          </div>
        
          <div class="article">
            <h4>Article 11</h4>
            <p>This article gives Parliament the power to make laws about who can be a citizen or lose citizenship.</p>
          </div>
        
          <h3>üßê Why is this Important?</h3>
          <p>When India became independent, we needed rules to know who was a citizen. Citizens have:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Rights:</strong> Only citizens can vote and have special rights.</li>
            <li><strong>Responsibilities:</strong> Citizens follow laws and help the country grow.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3>üîÑ Changes to Citizenship</h3>
          <p>Over time, the rules about citizenship have changed, like with the Citizenship Act of 1955. Parliament can change these rules as needed.</p>
          
          <h3>üí° Summary:</h3>
          <ul class="summary">
            <li>Part II explains who is an Indian citizen after independence.</li>
            <li>It covers people who moved between India and Pakistan and those living abroad.</li>
            <li>It gives Parliament the power to create and change laws about citizenship.</li>
          </ul>
